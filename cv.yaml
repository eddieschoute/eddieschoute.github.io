        title: Research Summer Internship
        company: Microsoft Research
        date: 2020
        location: Redmond (virtual), WA, USA
        description: >
            Research algorithms for executing circuits on quantum hardware.
            We use native operations to better use the hardware capabilities.
            I implemented a proof of concept in Julia language that shows a 5x speed-up over the state-of-the-art.

            Work performed with Vadym Kliuchnikov, Alexander Vaschillo, and Dmitry Vasilevsky.
