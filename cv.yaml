            NSF research for undergraduates (REU) work that I co-supervised.

            We present methods for implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints.
            Our protocols make use of previous methods for rapidly reversing the order of qubits along a path.
            Given nearest-neighbor interactions on a path of length n, we show that there exists a constant ϵ≈0.034 such that the quantum routing time is at most (1−ϵ)n, whereas any swap-based protocol needs at least time n−1.
            This represents the first known quantum advantage over swap-based routing methods and also gives improved quantum routing times for realistic architectures such as grids.
            Furthermore, we show that our algorithm approaches a quantum routing time of 2n/3 in expectation for uniformly random permutations, whereas swap-based protocols require time n asymptotically.
            Additionally, we consider sparse permutations that route k≤n qubits and give algorithms with quantum routing time at most n/3+O(k2) on paths and at most 2r/3+O(k2) on general graphs with radius r.

        title: Nearly optimal time-independent state reversal of a spin chain

        description: >
            We propose a time-independent Hamiltonian protocol for the reversal of qubit ordering in a chain of N spins.
            Our protocol has an easily implementable nearest-neighbor, transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian with time-independent, non-uniform couplings.
            Under appropriate normalization, we implement this state reversal three times faster than a naive approach using SWAP gates,
            in time comparable to a protocol of Raussendorf [Phys. Rev. A 72, 052301 (2005)] that requires dynamical control.
            We also prove lower bounds on state reversal by using results on the entanglement capacity of Hamiltonians and show that we are within a factor 1.502(1+1/N) of the shortest time possible.
            Our lower bound holds for all nearest-neighbor qubit protocols with arbitrary finite ancilla spaces and local operations and classical communication.
            Finally, we extend our protocol to an infinite family of nearest-neighbor, time-independent Hamiltonian protocols for state reversal.
            This includes chains with nearly uniform coupling that may be especially feasible for experimental implementation.

        description: >
            Quantum computer architectures impose restrictions on qubit interactions.
            We propose efficient circuit transformations that modify a given quantum circuit to fit an architecture,
            allowing for any initial and final mapping of circuit qubits to architecture qubits.
            To achieve this, we first consider the qubit movement subproblem and use the routing via matchings framework to prove tighter bounds on parallel routing.
            In practice, we only need to perform partial permutations, so we generalize routing via matchings to that setting.
            We give new routing procedures for common architecture graphs and for the generalized hierarchical product of graphs,
            which produces subgraphs of the Cartesian product. Secondly, for serial routing,
            we consider the token swapping framework and extend a 4-approximation algorithm for general graphs to support partial permutations.
            We apply these routing procedures to give several circuit transformations, using various heuristic qubit placement subroutines.
            We implement these transformations in software and compare their performance for large quantum circuits on grid and modular architectures,
            identifying strategies that work well in practice.

        title: Shortcuts to quantum network routing

        description: |
            A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once.

            Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation.
