        description: >
            A method for performing long-range multi-qubit measurements in a quantum circuit utilizes a graph that maps qubits of the quantum circuit to nodes that are connected to one another by edges. The method provides for identifying sets of the nodes on the graph corresponding to sets of qubits targeted by multi-qubit operations in a quantum algorithm and for defining a group of edge-disjoint paths connecting the nodes of each set. The group of edge-disjoint paths is defined such that no two of the paths in the group share an edge. The method further provides for performing a set of operations to entangle the qubits corresponding to the to the identified set of nodes that are included in each path in the group and for performing the set of multi-qubit operations on the entangled sets of the qubits.

            We study the problem of implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints in quantum systems that allow for arbitrarily fast local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In particular, we show examples of speedups over swap-based and more general unitary routing methods by distributing entanglement and using LOCC to perform quantum teleportation. We further describe an example of an interaction graph for which teleportation gives a logarithmic speedup in the worst-case routing time over swap-based routing. We also study limits on the speedup afforded by quantum teleportation - showing an O(sqrt(NlogN)) upper bound on the separation in routing time for any interaction graph - and give tighter bounds for some common classes of graphs.

        description: >
            The Swap gate is a ubiquitous tool for moving information on quantum hardware, yet it can be considered a classical operation because it does not entangle product states. Genuinely quantum operations could outperform Swap for the task of permuting qubits within an architecture, which we call routing. We consider quantum routing in two models: (1) allowing arbitrary two-qubit unitaries, or (2) allowing Hamiltonians with norm-bounded interactions. We lower bound the circuit depth or time of quantum routing in terms of spectral properties of graphs representing the architecture interaction constraints, and give a generalized upper bound for all simple connected n-vertex graphs. In particular, we give conditions for a superpolynomial classical-quantum routing separation, which exclude graphs with a small spectral gap and graphs of bounded degree. Finally, we provide examples of a quadratic separation between gate-based and Hamiltonian routing models with a constant number of local ancillas per qubit and of an Omega(n) speedup if we also allow fast local interactions.

        description: >
            We provide an efficient algorithm to compile quantum circuits for fault-tolerant execution. We target surface codes, which form a 2D grid of logical qubits with nearest-neighbor logical operations. Embedding an input circuit's qubits in surface codes can result in long-range two-qubit operations across the grid. We show how to prepare many long-range Bell pairs on qubits connected by edge-disjoint paths of ancillas in constant depth which can be used to perform these long-range operations. This forms one core part of our Edge-Disjoint Paths Compilation (EDPC) algorithm, by easily performing parallel long-range Clifford operations in constant depth. It also allows us to establish a connection between surface code compilation and several well-studied edge-disjoint paths problems. Similar techniques allow us to perform non-Clifford single-qubit rotations far from magic state distillation factories. In this case, we can easily find the maximum set of paths by a max-flow reduction, which forms the other major part of our EDPC algorithm. We compare EDPC to other compilation approaches including a SWAP-based algorithm, and find significantly improved performance for circuits built from parallel CNOTs, and for circuits which implement the multi-controlled X gate.

            NSF research for undergraduates (REU) work that I co-supervised.

            We present methods for implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints.
            Our protocols make use of previous methods for rapidly reversing the order of qubits along a path.
            Given nearest-neighbor interactions on a path of length n, we show that there exists a constant ϵ≈0.034 such that the quantum routing time is at most (1−ϵ)n, whereas any swap-based protocol needs at least time n−1.
            This represents the first known quantum advantage over swap-based routing methods and also gives improved quantum routing times for realistic architectures such as grids.
            Furthermore, we show that our algorithm approaches a quantum routing time of 2n/3 in expectation for uniformly random permutations, whereas swap-based protocols require time n asymptotically.
            Additionally, we consider sparse permutations that route k≤n qubits and give algorithms with quantum routing time at most n/3+O(k2) on paths and at most 2r/3+O(k2) on general graphs with radius r.

        title: Nearly optimal time-independent state reversal of a spin chain

        description: >
            We propose a time-independent Hamiltonian protocol for the reversal of qubit ordering in a chain of N spins.
            Our protocol has an easily implementable nearest-neighbor, transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian with time-independent, nonuniform couplings.
            Under appropriate normalization, we implement this state reversal three times faster than a naive approach using swap gates,
            in time comparable to a protocol of Raussendorf [Phys. Rev. A 72, 052301 (2005)] that requires dynamical control.
            We also prove lower bounds on state reversal by using results on the entanglement capacity of Hamiltonians and show that we are within a factor 1.502(1+1/N) of the shortest time possible.
            Our lower bound holds for all nearest-neighbor qubit protocols with arbitrary finite ancilla spaces and local operations and classical communication.
            We give numerical evidence that the fast reversal protocols are more robust to noise than a swap-based reversal.
            Finally, we extend our protocol to an infinite family of nearest-neighbor, time-independent Hamiltonian protocols for state reversal.
            This includes chains with nearly uniform coupling that may be especially feasible for experimental implementation.

        description: >
            Quantum computer architectures impose restrictions on qubit interactions.
            We propose efficient circuit transformations that modify a given quantum circuit to fit an architecture,
            allowing for any initial and final mapping of circuit qubits to architecture qubits.
            To achieve this, we first consider the qubit movement subproblem and use the routing via matchings framework to prove tighter bounds on parallel routing.
            In practice, we only need to perform partial permutations, so we generalize routing via matchings to that setting.
            We give new routing procedures for common architecture graphs and for the generalized hierarchical product of graphs,
            which produces subgraphs of the Cartesian product. Secondly, for serial routing,
            we consider the token swapping framework and extend a 4-approximation algorithm for general graphs to support partial permutations.
            We apply these routing procedures to give several circuit transformations, using various heuristic qubit placement subroutines.
            We implement these transformations in software and compare their performance for large quantum circuits on grid and modular architectures,
            identifying strategies that work well in practice.

            A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once.

            Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to be stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing decisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a model of entanglement generation.
